Our work together catapulted me into the higher level of professionalism and business operations I had always wanted to realize, but didn\u2019t know how to achieve. Vic made it easy, and made it seem like I got there all by myself. You\u2019ve heard the old adage, If a tree falls in the forest and no one is listening\u2026I\u2019ve witnessed Vic Desotelle\u2019s ability to put himself in the forest of every single individual in our group, no matter their position, or background. Before a tree even begins to think about falling, he is there, guiding their transformation of a potential disaster into an opportunity for expansion. Averting failure, Vic has facilitated their movement into a direction that capitalizes on their strengths, honors their truest vision, and celebrates their growth.\u201d<\/p>\n<div>\n<hr noshade=\"noshade\" size=\"1\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft\" title=\"Tim-Billing\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/Tim-Billing.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" \/>Tim Billing<br \/>\n<\/strong>Operations Director, IDEO Inc.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cFor many years, Vic has been an adviser of mine on issues related to the environment and sustainability .

I was very glad to have his help in developing a complex proposal for leadership transformation certification \u2013 his insightful perspective increased the value of the proposal by making sure we had participants engaged in co-designing the program. Vic is a designer to bring your collaborative programs into the present and helps you launch them into the future. Additionally, Vic is a good listener and deep inquirer with a broad understanding of the subtle nuances of collaboration design. He provided great energy, passion and inspiration in the stirring launch of the FutureTalk commmunity.

Whereas our company is very familiar with large, complex projects, we were not familiar with the emerging CAS concepts and theories. Vic did an excellent job of bringing us up-to-speed on CAS and helped us develop the proposal \u2014 which we could not have done without him. Vic was very helpful and supportive in working with us even though we were a new contact for him. Based on this initial contact, we have remained in touch and shared ideas.
