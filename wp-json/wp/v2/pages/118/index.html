This innovation matrix advances the design of communities using \u2018whole system\u2019 knowledge, realized within each center and shared world-wide, known as a &#8216;leadership ecology&#8217;. A community learning framework, along with unique mapping processes, are used to direct each center within the innovation matrix. Ecological design principles and sustainable business practices are followed that adapt to the needs of a globally conscious society. Collaboration methods are used to guide participants toward creating solutions that collectively serve and support a diverse yet interdependent, thriving world culture system.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16pt;\"><strong>Message for the Future<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\nThere are no rules, only choices. Let awe be your guide, let your walk be sacred, and learn to know who you are by being and watching that which you think you are not.

Its creation will be comprised of a model for bringing people together with common passions and interests who want to participate in the changes at hand, both at the visionary and practical levels of implementation. The frameworks for gathering and connecting people will be very open, allow for group and individual empowerment, be guided by principles of sustainability and collaborative learning, and allow those with knowledge and wisdom to lead rather than those with (so-called) power strength and money, and (rather than our present unhealthy forms for discussing and debating) it will be based on an open dialogue system for sharing and learning from a world of people who are wealthy with ideas. Together, from community-to-community, we will create a wonderful new reality.<\/p>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-118\" data-postid=\"118\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-118 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vic Desotelle Sustainability Innovator, Green Entrepreneur, Collaborative Design Facilitator, Change Agent, Leadership Coach, Social Mythic + + + &#8220;Mythic Dragons appear at the Earth\u2019s Horizon, as the Sun Inflects the Dawn of an Emerging New Culture &#8211; An Awakened Global Civilization, Ignited by Humanity\u2019s Inner Solar Rays.&#8221; + + + Vic\u2019s Insights and Inspirations We [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":8,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false,"footnotes":""},"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/P7WmHn-1U","builder_content":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/118"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=118"}],"version-history":[{"count":33,"href":"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/118\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":10866,"href":"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/118\/revisions\/10866"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=118"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
