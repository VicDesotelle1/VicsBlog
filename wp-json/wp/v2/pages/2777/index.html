But ethics management consists of more than knowing what to do once a problem arises. Appropriate ethical action can only be applied when company managers are committed to leading from an ethical rightness based on values, not just the law. A broader education on ethics can help to reduce legal action by teaching managers how to make clear decisions early in the process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The 6P&#8217;s of Ethical Influence<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">PRINCIPLE &#8211; PRACTICE &#8211; POLICY (organizational)<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">PEOPLE &#8211; PROFIT &#8211; PLANET (global)<\/p>\n<h4>These ethical concepts for company managers to comprehend:<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Know why doing the right thing is important as a principle.<\/li>\n<li>Know how to incorporate ethics as part of a daily decision-making practice.<\/li>\n<li>Know what the legal responsibilities of corporate and government policy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Knowing the &#8216;why, \u2018how&#8217;, and &#8216;what&#8217; of ethics allows managers to:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Intuitively respond to principle needs of involved stakeholders [the why].<\/li>\n<li>Exercise ethics as part of making quality day-to-day decisions, such as hiring employees, or determining the appropriateness of new technologies [the how].<\/li>\n<li>Rationally apply legal policy-correctness to ethical circumstances [the what].<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Right vs Right &#8211; Ethics for Managers<\/h2>\n<p>Based on the book &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Defining-Moments-Managers-Choose-Between\/dp\/0875848036?&amp;camp=212361&amp;linkCode=wsw&amp;tag=discfuel-20&amp;creative=380793\" target=\"_blank\">Defining Moments<\/a>&#8216; by Joseph Badaracco<\/p>\n<h3>Workshop 1 Description:<\/h3>\n<p>Ever find yourself choosing between corporate and personal values?

Multiple perspectives from great thinkers including Aristotle, Machiavelli, and William James will be considered.

By engaging in ethical conversations, a company actually opens doors to new forms of innovation at all levels of the enterprise &#8211; from hiring quality staff, to producing better products and services. The conversation will be focused on three primary influences upon organizational ethics: <strong>principles, practices, and policies<\/strong>.
