Have we lost our sense of how to be with each other in the messiness of our humanity? For me, today\u2019s sorely needed emerging leaders can not be likened anymore to the stoic guy on a horse riding off into the sunset after he single-handedly saves the town from Godzilla. Why? Because this guy (usually someone we all aspire to be) rarely shows the kind of emotion that allows for each of us to change ourselves &#8211; a <em>collective<\/em> <em>transformation<\/em>. Rather, the so-called hero tends to be about eliminating a problem by taking out the people that go with it. This doesn&#8217;t work anymore.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What if instead, we began to choose our leaders (at least in part) based on how well they have learned to express their emotions, and how well they exemplify<\/strong><strong> ways to share the messiness of their own humanity, while also being able to hold space for others to do the same?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I propose that we dare ourselves to allow more messiness in the workplace by helping to teach and \u201clead\u201d groups through spells of negative emotion, rather than try to find ways to avoid or expel it. No more heroes of elimination. The key here is teaching groups or teams to hold space for their peers during their time of need, rather than expect the so-called leader to do it alone. This is known as collective leadership, or an ecology of leadership. And I believe that, using this approach, gold can be found within the mines (minds?) of our organizations, which will generate amazing new forms of innovation. Why? Because <strong><em>the form and function of all innovation is the result of the expression of\u00a0 the group (or company) who created it<\/em><\/strong>. Seems we may have forgotten the fact that companies are made of people, from which products and services are an outcome; and not the other way around?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Daniel Goleman\u2019s talk on TED<\/strong><strong>\u00a0points to this evolved form of leadership that I speak of here.<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"post-video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Daniel Goleman: Why arent we all Good Samaritans?\" width=\"1165\" height=\"655\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/r3wyCxHtGd0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>It starts with what he calls a \u2018human moment\u2019, which are the times when we are paying full attention to the person(s) we are with. He suggests that <em><strong>there is zero correlation between intelligence and the awareness of another (this is known as compassion)<\/strong><\/em>. Yet we hire our leaders and managers almost completely based on their level of intelligence and rarely rate them based on their ability to express themselves, to show compassion, or their ability hold a group through troubling periods. Why is that?<\/p>\n<p>Also interesting is that <em><strong>he correlates the rapid growth of information to compassion<\/strong><\/em>, and it makes sense! Creating this new synergy of perspectives begins to define what I like to call an &#8216;ecology of leadership&#8217; &#8211; a new process of thought and relationship-building. It is an evolved form of collaboration where, as we become more present to the relationships in our lives, it actually helps to form a unified &#8216;whole&#8217; world that works better, while also increasing personal identity and\u00a0 individual value at the same time. How cool is that?!<\/p>\n<p>Now, this is a bit of a paradox because our increasing access to information often pulls us away from being present with each other. But we have to remember that both are happening at the same time. What I am trying to suggest is that an <strong>ecology of leadership<\/strong>, along with increased awareness of our relationships, is changing the meaning of \u2018professionalism\u2019. It is morphing into something completely different than we know it today. In ecological terms, this means that even <em>the concept of \u201cthe leader\u201d has lived out it&#8217;s time<\/em>, and we now need to consider what a collective leadership can look like. This evolutionary process will empower each of us, rather than just a mere few of us, and can then be carried into any group dynamics to <em>help generate a deeper form of authenticity, purpose, and meaning within ourselves and our companies<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If your mind is spinning a bit, it suggests that the well goes deep here. I plan to write more about this in my blogging.

This begins to define a true ecology of thought and being and I feel that this is where we are headed &#8211; a collaboration of relationships that connect as we become more present moment to moment in our lives. Now, this is a bit of a paradox because our increased access to information so often pulls us away from being present with another, right? Well, both are happening. Now, I am aware that my writing is moving in a number of directions, but hang in there with me.&lt;\/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am trying to suggest an &lt;strong&gt;ecology of leadership &lt;\/strong&gt;and the relationships and awareness that make this up.

In ecological terms, this means that even the idea of &amp;ldquo;the leader&amp;rdquo; is old, and that we instead need to consider the possibility of what a collective leadership would look like and how this carried into group dynamics can help to generate a deeper form of authenticity within ourselves and our companies.&lt;\/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I plan to write about this later on in my blogging.
