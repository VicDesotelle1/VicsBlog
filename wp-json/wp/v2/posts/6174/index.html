Instead, team building is done using separate programs, like climbing trees together, or goofy games that create bonding. Yeah, it does that to an extent. But there is nothing better than a team that builds itself amidst the project they are working on &#8211; and doing that consciously together.<\/p>\n<p>Now &#8216;that&#8217; is the best way to build teams in my view.<\/p>\n<p>It is a method that I emphasize strongly during the discovery process as I believe it is the way to fuel deeper forms of innovation.
