I&#8217;m so relieved, and quite jazzed, about seeing signs of real change, captured within key phrases that were noted. A shift in the integrity of mind and heart about business and the model of capitalism.<\/p>\n<p>His notes suggest to me that, just maybe, we are finally around the knee of the wake up curve, where many of the speakers seemed to be recognizing the need for a different kind of change in business, that so far has merely been rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2013\/04\/monsterteeth.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-8984\" alt=\"monsterteeth\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2013\/04\/monsterteeth-300x297.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\" srcset=\"https:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2013\/04\/monsterteeth-300x297.jpg 300w, https:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2013\/04\/monsterteeth-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2013\/04\/monsterteeth.jpg 410w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>Within the language of his notes, there are signals of a readiness to alter our formula for what business is, how we do it, and why &#8230; what it&#8217;s real purpose is. While moving away from concepts that have merely cloaked more of the same destructive activity that continues to occur.<\/p>\n<p>I will also be so bold (dare I say?) that I was relieved not to see the word used that has represented a mission we have all adored as our savior for so many years &#8211; &#8216;sustainability&#8217;. LOL! Suggesting to me we have to go beyond what it represents in order to achieve it.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, to also see that people were questioning even the conference theme itself (as in the last note) by stating: <strong>&#8220;Does the phrase &#8216;conscious capitalism&#8217; further instill the corporation with misplaced personhood?&#8221;<\/strong>\u00a0This is where I hope to see a powerful generative conversation to emerge.
