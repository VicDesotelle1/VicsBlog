They are trying to get youth inspired, which is most important. But now I watch things like this and feel deeply that something is missing. This approach, exciting as it may be, has been attempted over the ages in different forms and mediums, and yet NOTHING has changed &#8211; Our situation has only gotten worse, hasn&#8217;t it?<\/p>\n<p>I listen to\u00a0my own voice monitoring what I am seeing,\u00a0with the question &#8216;what is truth?&#8217;, while assuming my\u00a0own\u00a0voice may not be correct. The voice that speaks back is my\u00a0TRUTH, as I see it today. Unfortunately, the truth that speaks is nothing close to what juiced up videos like this are trying to offer.\u00a0SO WHAT IS MISSING?<\/p>\n<p>Listen to the language in the video &#8211; It&#8217;s of &#8216;revolution&#8217;, not &#8216;evolution&#8217;. It is NOT about &#8216;evolving&#8217;, but rather about &#8216;revolting&#8217;. This is nothing but the same, which we have all seen through the millennia.<\/p>\n<p>Humanity can NOT go through another REVOLUTION &#8230; It will take ALL of us down, not just some of us. The next revolution will be humanity&#8217;s last.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, how do we move ourselves into an awareness of EVOLUTIONARY (not revolutionary) perspective? I want to see the youth dancing to an evolved way of being. No more to fighting what has never worked, except for an elitist few. It is time we tell that new story differently &#8211; the story of an evolved humanity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>I say this to the youth mostly &#8230;<\/strong>\u00a0Since my generation, and those before me, have failed their future:\u00a0WE NOW HAVE TO\u00a0DEPEND ON YOU.
