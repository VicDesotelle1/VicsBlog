This density can be realized physically, emotionally, mentally, or spiritually (we usually only consider \u2018physical\u2019 densities in our science). \u2018Lensing\u2019 then, is way to bring focus to something and is what makes it apparent (a parent). Awareness and attention (a tension) of it initiates gravity and allows its birth into the world. [For example, when a telescope sees a star, &#8230; {not complete}].\u00a0\u00a0Values themselves are concepts (mental particles) that are like spinning star-dust. As these particles begin to cluster, they form into groupings (like planets, etc.) that take on identities of their own \u2013 separate from the individual particles that created them. This is \u2018value-density\u2019 and is identified by the organizing principals that initiated their gathering (relates to WILL-gravity). Initially, the gathering comes from a desire to connect or be with other (relates to INTENTION-grace). [The {3rd point? of this trinity} relates to gratitude, &#8230;{not complete}]. This trinity is otherwise known as one point in a higher trinity set, that is called \u2018LOVE\u2019 (the other 2 points in this set are Truth and Beauty). Love is a compassionate way of saying \u2018value-density\u2019. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inknowvate.com\/inknowvate\/trinity_concepts.htm\" class=\"broken_link\">http:\/\/www.inknowvate.com\/inknowvate\/trinity_concepts.htm<\/a><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>What I am describing here can be one of the deeper levels of the organizational mapping system.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial;\">I saw Peter Russell last night, and it trigger my connection with the Great Archives of Knowledge (or a psychotic state of Self-absorption (same thing)). As part of our watchfulness, it was interesting that the main theme that came up in his presentation for me was the idea of WATCHING. In my trinity model (structure, pattern, process), I believe that the \u201cthought-geometry\u201d we discussed is the \u2018structural\u2019 aspect for release (or escape), where the tetragramatron configuration associated with the Egyptian pyramids allows for focus and amplification of consciousness entering (becoming) Matter. The watching part is the action or \u2018process\u2019 necessary for the structure to become \u2018bendable\u2019 (like the spoon in Matrix (Ecology to Economy)), thereby allowing for the shaping of a portal from which we can move from the entramped feeling of being in a box we no longer want to be in, to the outside of the box \u2013 all, by the way, done through a change in perception. Seeing the \u2018patterns\u2019 that emerge then is the art of the Master shaping his\/her World (Equity to Ecology). Once the cell wall of the intentional field is closed (or completed), thereby holding in the pattern (i.e. The mondala\u2019s vessel for expression), then consciousness in\u2019forms\u2019 the mind through permeation (or vibration) of the cell wall, which is how our newly emerged pattern identity stays in relationship with all that is (i.e. no One is alone (Economy to Equity)). It is the birth of a new view of the Universe (the god Argo). Now our new cell\u2019s identity can\u2019t not be seen by others until a percentage of other cells (usually ones that are also in the flux of its own emergence- i.e. Cultural Creatives) also identify (or resonate) with the new cell\u2019s view. [I believe that it\u2019s not as much a percentage as much as it is a spiralic influence (or rate of spin of activity) that ultimately creates the whirling movement into a black hole; which is Matter becoming dense.] It\u2019s interesting to note that there is a relationship between this concept and DEpression. As Spirit impresses Itself on the cell, the cell becomes EXpressive (anouncing to the World who he\/she is), and through that expression Spirit gets COMpressed into Matter (another way of saying manifestation). Depression then, is the return cycle of release, where the Myth generated by the first downward incorporation of Spirit into Matter (Flow), now returns to its Source (Eb) to be remember with the Greater Whole (God). This Eb process begins with a DECOMpression point of awareness (consciousness) realizes that its own pattern identity is no longer in resonance with the outer cells vibration(s)(change). With \u2018depression\u2019 comes the inherent release of emotion (Spirit) from what has Mattered. During the Return, we pass again through the state of expression. But since there is hysteresis involved, it is MUCH more difficult to unleash Spirit from its previous Matter realization (hysteresis is Matter\u2019s gate-keepers (the Lizards) holding onto what it knows. Love then is sensed during the downward entry of Spirit into Matter (a moving rush of joy- Birth), and Fear mostly comes during the return (release) of Spirit back into the Greater Beingness (motionless- Death). Since our work is emergent and not yet identifiable by enough other cells, the gravitation field is too small to be sensated by the human condition. Thus, it is important for us to converse, write, etc. about our new reality through a \u201cwatchful\u201d subtle eye. It is that watchfulness that allows a higher amplitude of vibration to be expressed (i.e. Outword from our cell). As other\u2019s begin to resonate with that vibration, the gravity of the subject becomes more and more objective \u2013 i.e. Manifestation from Spirit into Matter, whether that Matter is a mate or a career.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial;\">Be Watchful Today:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Helvetica,Arial;\">Vessel of Matter<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; What is your question?

It is different than &#8216;transformation&#8217; where this identifies form-change without atomic alteration (such as changing lead into gold, which is atomic alteration). Mythically, this relates to our cultural DNA altering its potential resulting in a new way of being. Myth underlyes the way we see the World and thereby how it forms itself. Myth is the story that, once unfolded, reveals the essence of -how- we are from -who- we think we are. Once realized and expressed, Myth can &#8216;morph&#8217; (as in transmutation) into something that it was not previously. I see that our global (Gaia) system is undergoing a Mythical transmutation. As we become aware of the Myths from which we each independantly engage our World, we come to see that they are no longer working well. Thus, a new Myth will be created. Through an awakening process, this new Myth can emerge consciously (rather than the old myth, which is innately unconscious). Our separate national cultures will become understood within a global identity; a new more integrated Mythology for existance. Unlike the Phoenix which dies first and from its ashes comes renewal (transformation), the new &#8216;transmuted&#8217; Myth will be more like the alchemical process of turning one metal into another.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">freedom &gt; fate<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">slavery &gt; destiny<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\">&#8230; you are working on a VERY profound and important ideal that bridges the gap between Spirit (Godness), Consciousness (the Bridge), and Matter (physcial Universe). As I like to say: &#8220;It&#8217;s in the Spirit (father) of what Matters&#8221; (mother) which results in our Offspring (Child) {new World]. By identifying human patterns of communication &#8211; through our use of symbology &#8211; we can influence physical phenomena. In a word &#8220;Magic&#8221; &#8230; real Magic, not hocus pocus magic. This is the realm where the Dark and Light Powers of the Universe (the Gods) play ball. It is the place where All becomes manifest. The Taro, and all other forms of Mythic representation, are merely a result of man trying to express the Energetic focal points from which interference patterns are generated &#8230; thus Matter emerges. The interplay of the 10 points on the Kabalistic framework are merely reflected images of the Taro cards and are expressions of Consciousness realizing Itself. It is this critical stage when we Humans go from being conscious (magical experience) to Beings that are aware of Consciousness (Magic-makers), and thus defines the chasm before us. Will we fly or fall?<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>A couple thoughts regarding symbology itself:<\/p>\n<p>1- Through personal review, I propose that the &#8216;dimensionality&#8217; of our symbolism be considered. That is, not just the kinds of symbolisms that are used, but also the symbolism of symbolism (what I call the &#8216;squared principle&#8217;) be contemplated as well. It is this level of awareness that will be necessary to penetrate the veil of deception (neutral statement) that we are all under at this present time.<\/p>\n<p>2- It will be necessary to use an additional language (i.e. symbolic set) in parallel with the English language (the pprimary communication tool of the global community). This is because the linear-ness of the English language inhibits us from sharing\/expressing wholistic concepts.<\/p>\n<p>3- The Mythology (neutral) from which we realize ourselves is collapsing. This time of chaos, which carries both danger and opportunity, is what the Consciousness edge IS.<\/p>\n<p>4- As Joseph Campbell (my Myth-mentor) said: Heaven IS on Earth.<\/p>\n<p>What an amazing time to Be alive.<\/p>\n<p>Vic<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\">What are your underlying concerns about religion? My question relates to the following: The way we humans organize is deeply linked to our underlying values, of which are often connected to our religious belief systems. Religion is the primary framework that we use (often unconsciously) to see our World. Thus, in order to be agents of change (assuming change is needed), I propose that &#8216;change agents&#8217; need to consider what holds our exisiting orders of organization in place. I have found that the deeper I journey into the ways we humans organize (at any type or level of culture), the closer I find the need to review religious belief systems.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\">the triple bottom line (and its overall 5-point architecture) as a framework for managing community values and assets.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">organizing hierachy:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">community mythology<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">regional commerce<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">enterprise architecture<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">organizational development<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">business methodology<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">company practices<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">&#8211; we offer unique value as a company by integrating <strong>facilation<\/strong> (fluid, patterning, enabling, learning) with <strong>training<\/strong> (structured, directed, teaching) &#8230; i.e. &#8216;whole-system&#8217; by definition<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">&#8211; link &#8216;learning collaboratories&#8217; process with follow-up &#8216;needs assessment&#8217; recommendations, drew sherlocks the symptoms while vic leads the facilitation<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">&#8211; write an article on the relationship between the science of company DNA and the ???

Ultimately, the final<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">system of analysis is Universe. At the core, change-learning is the process<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">of understanding how the sub-system fits into Universe. To accomplish this,<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">would most defintiely require constant change of not only the understanding<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">but also, of how one actually learns&#8230;.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">The benefits of change-learning stem from the new and innovative solutions<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">that it fosters. These benefits arise out of fundmental changes to the ways<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">people understand the issues they are meeting about.

Otherwise known as the &#8216;Cultural Creatives&#8217; marketplace, these customers are interested in buying from companies that offer more than a good product, and they&#8217;ll pay more for it.

It occurred to me that the underlying mythology for how we build our cities is visibly evident, revealed within\u00a0a primary archetypal pattern: the square. From\u00a0rural\u00a0farms to urban neighborhoods, our primary organizing pattern for\u00a0building\u00a0is done via a matrix of crossing grid-lines bounded by a square.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">It bothered me for some time until I worked with a Sacred Architect friend of mine. Then, my concern changed into questions: What if that revealing square pattern was different? How might a different kind of pattern reflect a vitality that is missing within our societies and ecosystems? These questions helped me to discover that, our human technical society builds itself primarily based on squared straight lines set at 90 degree angles whenever possible.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">Then, further insight came to me during a\u00a0recent study with the &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. institute.

That is, how much a business can make ($)\u00a0relative to how much it takes ($) to create and sell a client a widget. The money gets measured in isolation without regard to (or linking it to) the company&#8217;s product and services value propositions. From a 3BL perspective, although we are supposedly in a TQM-oriented business environment, financial quantity (low end economics-structures) over-ride product quality (ecological design-processes) and consumer satisfaction (social equity-behavior patterns).<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">&#8211; Commission-based sales programs are counter intuitive to creating relational-based client management programs. Putting them together by commissioning a sales person to build relationships\u00a0only generates employee resentment and client dissent, and a sales person&#8217;s inability to continue to build client relationship through and beyond the LIFE SPAN of the product or service being offered. Ironically, it has been determined that the greatest expenses in a business is building clientele, and yet there are no insentives to build long term relationships with them, since there are no money incentives (i.e. value proposition points) that are prolonged after a sales is made.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">&#8211; In a 1BL model, consumerism is the driving force behind business development lead by sales and marketing (with design engineering and innovation lagging).

It also deals with the way Life organizes\u00a0Itself via the Consciousness Flame; otherwise known as the Bridge between Spirit and Matter. Applying organizing frameworks that allow our human cultures to learn and evolve upon themselves is key to successfully manifesting &#8216;purpose&#8217; within the structures and environments that you mention. Incorporating &#8216;Organizational Architecture&#8217;\u00a0can help your temple projects to shift\u00a0cultural behavior patterns that allow for the realization of a more sustainable, sacred, global\u00a0culture. This is the process of integrating the World&#8217;s presently independent village-oriented Myths (myths are transparent cultural belief systems) to bring forth a new interdependent Global Mythology &#8230; thus the concept of &#8216;sacred architecture&#8217; has deep meaning for me.<\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><tt>Sustainability as a concept can be defined as a \"set of principles\" that<\/tt><\/span><\/p>\n<p>preempts a &#8220;way of practice&#8221;. That is, SUSTAINABILITY (a set of principles)<\/p>\n<p>carry the seeds for determining what INNOVATION (a way of practice) will<\/p>\n<p>look like in this 21st-century. Or, to put it in other words: To actually<\/p>\n<p>become sustainable, we cannot focus on sustainability as actions (or ways of<\/p>\n<p>practice) but instead see sustainability as guidelines (or a set of<\/p>\n<p>principles) for creating and innovating. Seeing sustainability as guiding<\/p>\n<p>principles rather than direct actions can help us to differentiate what we<\/p>\n<p>define, what we do, and what is the result where becoming sustainable is a<\/p>\n<p>result of seeing our world differently (principle) and then acting based on<\/p>\n<p>that new view (practice). In this way, we can create a human(e) World in<\/p>\n<p>symbios with our Earth as a whole &#8230; a whole of which we are intimately<\/p>\n<p>apart, not upon. Differentiating &#8216;sustainable principles&#8217; from &#8216;innovative<\/p>\n<p>practices&#8217; can help us to re-build our communities so that they (we) are<\/p>\n<p>aware of ourselves as part of a more conscious, peaceful, creative, global<\/p>\n<p>culture.<\/p>\n<p>Similar to sustainability, peace is not an action in and of itself, but is<\/p>\n<p>instead a -result- of practices based on a set of principles that exemplify<\/p>\n<p>peace. If we want peace, let us not spend our energy protesting war because<\/p>\n<p>it gives focus to an old, no longer useful mythology for creating our World;<\/p>\n<p>one which sees ourselves as groupings of empires and kingdoms. In that myth,<\/p>\n<p>the idea of war carries power. Let us instead become part of a culturally<\/p>\n<p>creative movement that can shape a new myth for how we see ourselves. To do<\/p>\n<p>this, we must first come to know what peace is and what peace would feel<\/p>\n<p>like inside ourselves and within our communities. Then, together we can<\/p>\n<p>create a set of guiding principles, followed by enacted practices that can<\/p>\n<p>move us toward a way of life where sustainability and peace are inherent in<\/p>\n<p>who we have become.<\/p>\n<p>Vic<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Whole-systems modeling<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><strong>PRACTICAL<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">See <a href=\"http:\/\/www.inknowvate.com\/\">www.inKNOWvate.com<\/a>\u00a0 under &#8216;<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">triple bottom line map<\/span>&#8216; for a useable business systems model.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">I can explain how I am using this with a couple small businesses I am consulting.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><strong>PHILOSOPHICAL<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">generating\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 receiving\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 resulting<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">archetype\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 anomaly\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 condition<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">(imply)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (apply)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (exply)<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">pattern &#8211;&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 inspiration &#8211;&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 principle\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [spiritual &#8211; energy]<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">process &#8211;&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 innovation &#8211;&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 practice\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [mental &#8211; conscious bridge]<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">structure &#8211;&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 invention &#8211;&gt;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 policy\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [material &#8211; form]<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">I often describe &#8216;systems&#8217; perspectives to technology-oriented companies by describing the difference between INNOVATION and INVENTION.

It is the result of -inspired- aha&#8217;s that show up in dreams, walks in the forest, and through conscious questioning of our state of being. There is very little innovation in our society today. The reason (I believe) is because of the intense focus on invention in relationship to our present economic system, where making a dollar relies on one being able to sell something. In this state, inventiveness carries more weight than innovativeness. This is not a bad thing but rather out of balance in a time where innovation (not invention) is necessary to move us into the next stage of human(e) consciousness. Note that the idea of -inspiration- is critical here (a premonition of innovation) but I will leave this for another time.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">That&#8217;s innovation. To create invention, the mind simply improves or tunes existing mental patterns and processes (a result of the original innovation) that make an idea better and better, such as the rocket-ship that is now known as a &#8216;space shuttle&#8217;. The original innovative -principles- along with improved -processes- resulted in dynamically more effective -structures- &#8230; that&#8217;s invention.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">Any Whole-System &#8211; of which the Trinity expresses its interdependent experiences necessary for wholeness &#8211; is ascribed with the Fourth aspect. Thus, the number 4 realizes its deeper meaning and purpose &#8230; completeness, which becomes known (consciousness) through the characteristics that emerge from the relationships between the 3 trinity aspects. The result of their relationships, generates an inner fullness (value\/overstanding) and an outer emptiness (learning\/understanding), which -in their comparative differences- Spirit is &#8216;allowed&#8217; to move into Matter (or into &#8216;what matters&#8217;).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">MORE WHOLE-SYSTEMS MODELING<\/span><\/p>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;\">Your workshop exercise is the *quantifiable* (strategy) piece.

This is done by building an internal group of individuals that are of the same weave of cloth and building a position for their request to be considered. However, this is only a request for change. The company (I believe) can not actually create -sustainable- change without going to its core to determine and transform its organizing mythology (organizational architecture). This process is initiated with &#8220;values-based&#8221; conversations, evolves into changing the *principles* on which the company was founded, which is then linked to new *practices* based on those principles, and finally development of company *policies* that can monitor its new practices relative to the espoused principles.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><strong>8 gate process<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">I&#8217;ve applied your list to my framework to see where the strengths and weaknesses are for providing a whole-system solution.

font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">I support your comments. Some of the sustainable modeling that I&#8217;ve been working on is based on the &#8216;triple-bottom-line&#8217; concept which seems to be catching hold internationally. However, I am defining and using the term differently than how I am seeing it used at present.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">The emergence of sustainability (for me) means that first there is a growing gut-feeling of something not working right. That &#8216;something&#8217; has triggered the sustainability movement and suggests that we are beginning to recognize a accelerated break-down of existing cultural norms and community structures; not just at local isoloated levels but at a global inteconnected level. This, I believe is validated by the common threads of conversation occuring online relating to sustainability from all forms of communities on all continents. Thus, sustainability seems to be a request coming from an emerging collective consciousness desiring change out of a necessity to sustain our well-being. This is not just a systemic change, which to me means we would be using the same view or framework for seeing and changing our World, but instead is a quantum-system change which means that we have stepped out of our exising framework or mythology of who we think we are and how we make choices. Ultimately, it means the redesign of our human identity.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">Now, this identity change directly relates to the design and innovation conversations that O2 members subscribe to. It is this deeper conversation that I believe will help us as designers to develop, and also receive acceptance for, new forms of products and offerings that are more appropriate for a conscious global culture. They will be the result of a new framework for organizing ourselves and our activities and relates to what I like to call a &#8216;regenerative commerce system&#8217;; one that provides Ecological, Economical, and Equitable products and services to our global communities. This is the triple bottom line, also known as the 3E&#8217;s.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">Just as sustainability is defined in many different ways, these three E&#8217;s are also used in many different ways. &#8216;Ecology&#8217; for example, is often used as another word for &#8216;environment&#8217; when actually the word means interdependency of systems. It&#8217;s really an activity; a verb or adjective and not a noun. Even the related word &#8216;environment&#8217; is seen as a thing separate from the human condition rather than intimately apart of who we are. Its definition actually means: The complex of social and cultural conditions affecting the \u2018nature\u2019 of individuals and their communities, both human and non-human.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">Similarily, the understanding of what Equity means. Equity is often categorized with the idea of justice and human rights. This may be true, but when the word is studied a bit further, it actually relates to our notion of &#8216;choices&#8217;. For me, the word equity means the ability for a community to offer diverse choices to its stakeholders and community members and depends on those members having the know-how and ability to accept the responsibility of making healthier choices from a broader framework of understanding and questioning. Choices that can sustain not only the individuals doing the choosing but also enhance the well-being of the greater community.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">The third &#8216;E&#8217; is Economy which is also often used as a same-as replacement for the word money. However, it actually has nothing to do with money directly. The dictionary&#8217;s definition says it means &#8216;management of home or place&#8217;, where that place can be an ant colony, a forest, a company, a city, a nation, a planet, etc.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">Finally, the inter-relationship between these 3E&#8217;s is what makes up a measureable system for exchanging money. Money is merely the symbol for the actions of exchange that occur between people as a result of seeing the whole system&#8217;s inter-dependencies (ecology), system relationships (equity), and system management (economy). I like to use a dollar sign with three lines rather than one or two lines running through the S to help identify the difference between single and triple bottom line.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial Black; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">This &#8216;sustainability&#8217; topic actually triggers a larger conversation about &#8216;innovations&#8217; and how it is different than &#8216;inventions&#8217;.

We must see it in order to transform it. When the Anunakee genetically linked their male sperm with an Earth mother&#8217;s egg, it was their <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">intention<\/span><\/strong> to create a slave being that &#8216;seeded&#8217; our culture&#8217;s servant-based revolutions which has been the basis for ourselves and our Earth&#8217;s destruction.

My work is based on organizational mythological change. That is, a quantum shift in the way we run our organizations and restructuring the values and processes that direct them. My concern is that, during times of dramatic change, organizational developers are still attempting to apply strategy-only concepts to companies. It is an approach that is guaranteed to fail.

each of which generates different patterns of identity invisibly as to how the structure looks and how we identify it &#8230;. patterning is identification &#8230;. the name &#8216;rythmal&#8217; is the next key word in SPP which is &#8216;<strong>rhythm<\/strong>&#8216; which is a conscious dance that a subject or object chooses to identify with, the dance is the essence of character of an organization, SPP and the way they are modeled generate the rhythm of an organization, and through that rhythm creates <strong>meaning<\/strong> &#8230; this gives me a tetrahedron of SPP on the center 3-point plane with two extending points: one is rhythm, the other is meaning; these are actually two pyramids (3sided,not 4) with their bases connected to each other &#8230; as these two move in and out of each other, rhythm and meaning amplitudes cross each other&#8217;s points, &#8230; also within it are two directional spirals within each pyramid that cross each other generating the dualistic <strong>masculine<\/strong>\/<strong>feminine<\/strong> nature where rhythm is feminine and meaning is masculine in nature .. SPP are neutral unless you gone onto the plane, the structure its masculine, process is interdeterminant, and pattern is feminine ??? not sure yet &#8230; <strong>so how does this rythmal ball model and the above dynamics help inKNOWvate create 3-dimensional enterprise that can withstand the dynamic stresses of a 21-century organization??<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/p>\n<p>relate the 3 primary colors red, yellow, blue relate to the trinity concept? ecology, equity, economy? &#8230;. use to create a color map<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/p>\n<p>integrated conversation uses 4 trinities: grace gratitude gravity, love truth beauty, principle practice policy, ecology economy equity .. others &#8230; what is the emergent geometry that is generated??<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/p>\n<p>the depletion of the planet and our religious belief are tightly connected &#8230; the way we (not what we consume) is directly connect to our religion values and traditions .. christmas is the best example &#8230; its original form however was related to abundance; now it has been turned inside out into taking as much as we can get, which an overshoot from being deprived previously??<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>how does bouncing relate to boundaries &#8230; tigger is able to bounce, but he was very overwhelming to others because he bounced into others boundaries<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/p>\n<p>the best analogy to describe a &#8216;whole-system&#8217; is the <strong><span style=\"font-size: large;\">rainbow<\/span><\/strong>, where it is a refraction of light through millions of separate raindrops, yet somehow our eyes decipher it as an integrated whole rainbow in the sky &#8230; the <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">fractal whole<\/span><\/span><\/strong> would be the larger rainbow &#8230; the separate rainbows are generated from each raindrop and are the <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">fractured parts<\/span><\/span> &#8230;<\/strong> use this to describe whole-system innovation<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/p>\n<p>to describe org arch as a 3D sphere i suggest that plains are formed by 2 spheres intersecting each other &#8230; how does this relate to org. development formations relate to this spherical interference view?<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">MEMORY INSIGHT (structure process pattern related)<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">mkaufman&#8217;s finding old hendrix work he did &#8230; he has forgotten that he had already done the same hendrix book we are now doing together: INSIGHT &#8211; in the trinity cycle\/path of energy movement, an organism can not create memory while in the first cycle of being since it can not be aware of itself because it only IS itself without identifying by seeing (or stepping out of) itself.
