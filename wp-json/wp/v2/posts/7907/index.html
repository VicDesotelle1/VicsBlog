Similar to the model for energy, which has both electric and magnetic characteristics, so too should we look at our organizations and acknowledge that people and activities that do not directly impact the production line, are still critically important to the company&#8217;s health and thereby its sell-able products and services.<\/p>\n<p>If production correlates to electricity, then induction correlates to magnetism, which are self defining from one to the other. Those that carry the keys to the magnetic state of the organization are found in areas such as a company&#8217;s EHS (Environmental Health and Safety) group. The characteristics of these groups tend toward relational, which is opposite of the productivity side of the house, which is informational. Hand in hand informing (I) and relating (R) bring together the electro-magnetic charge of the organization. If done in the correct formula, the combined IR literally brings a company to life.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/imgres?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=Npo&amp;sa=X&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;biw=1238&amp;bih=713&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvnsb&amp;tbnid=djwP6J89Wii9wM:&amp;imgrefurl=http:\/\/skonieczna.wordpress.com\/2009\/05\/04\/chaos-theory-fractals-and-the-complexity-of-existence\/&amp;docid=EhK-J3ivi25e9M&amp;imgurl=http:\/\/www.enchgallery.com\/fractals\/fractal%252520images\/vessel.jpg&amp;w=576&amp;h=576&amp;ei=-dJ4T-r8GsWSiAKAvLCnDg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=2842&amp;sig=105278700756533662315&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=159&amp;tbnw=162&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=16&amp;ved=1t:429,r:7,s:0&amp;tx=47&amp;ty=115\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright wp-image-7911\" title=\"vessel\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/vessel-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"272\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/vessel-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/vessel-300x300.jpg 300w, http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/vessel.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px\" \/><\/a>Today however, many organizations have lost their life or &#8216;soul&#8217;, because I and R are so far out of balance. Growth is often misinterpreted as a company being full of life-giving attributes. Only to find out that, when you speak to the individuals in the organization, it is a wasteland of dismayed people. For a company to run as a whole system, and to actively induce rather than only promote innovation, it must bring its vital charging abilities back in line with its producing capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Since I have now decreed that my blog postings are to be works in progress, I hope you will pardon my chicken scratch in my sketch below. Hand-to-pen is still the best way for me to initiate insight and move it toward an innovative potential.<\/p>\n<p>By incorporating the below map, a company becomes apart of an &#8220;Ecology of Design&#8221;, which I have written about in this blog. Now we can begin to build a true commerce ecosystem, done by enabling the other half of the manifest equation, as described above.
