The interesting thing is that Frank is not a scientist by definition, rather he is an ARTIST. I have always believed that artists are the initiators of new innovation as they design through inspiration and passion. Once the art is realized, then the scientist grounds it in physics. Read the book <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/0688123058?tag=discoveryfuel-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0688123058&amp;adid=0A303914310DE5FCG044\" target=\"_blank\">Art and Physics<\/a> by Lenard Schlain and you will see what I mean. Then watch Frank&#8217;s video series below and you tell me: What does Frank&#8217;s work do for your understanding of how life works? For me, he has uncovered an amazing discovery that will fuel the future of innovation in medicine and beyond.<\/p>\n<div class=\"post-video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"1 Frank Chester Sacred Geometry\" width=\"1165\" height=\"874\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/_ujfk4fhYi4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Could below be why an egg is shaped like an egg?<\/p>\n<div class=\"post-video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Relationship between a 5-cycle and a 7-cycle - New Sacred Geometry by Frank Chester\" width=\"1165\" height=\"874\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/p9g4FJVZ9H8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-5623\" data-postid=\"5623\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-5623 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Artist Frank Chester has discovered how the heart works.
