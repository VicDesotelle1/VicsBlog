You know &#8211; the ones society locks up because they are nut cases, insane, crazy, out of touch with reality? Good thing too. This place helps to keep us nut jobs off the streets so that truly sane people can be in authority and do the great work they are doing, without a bunch of dimmed light bulbs like us getting in their way.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8042\" title=\"43e04d6a45dec01678b9b6c97edf0d0f\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/43e04d6a45dec01678b9b6c97edf0d0f-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/>How hard it must be for our authorities to have cultural misfits like me hanging around them.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well, the nice people here, the ones that wear those neat little white suits, have helped me to understand that my &#8217;bouts of speaking truth is too painful to hear. It hurts them and I must stop. I&#8217;m really trying to stop. And my visions; seeing things and all &#8211; they are wrong, dangerous, and bad. My actions have been hurting all those good people who are running our society. I&#8217;m so sorry to have hindered their way. They are so smart and intelligent and compassionate and right. How could I have done what I did, and said what i said to them? I must be truly mad. It&#8217;s good that I&#8217;m put away now.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8043\" title=\"johnny-depp-mad-hatter\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/johnny-depp-mad-hatter-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/>Funny how in-sane I&#8217;ve become over time.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I can see my craziness when I talk to my\u00a0cuckoo friends in here, because they make more sense to me than the people outside. Can you imagine thinking this way? I know, probably not. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been told I need a lot of help. I get scared when they tell me these things and I have to take more pills. Sure is a good thing for the medicine though. It keeps me calm and helps me to realize there is nothing I can do and that it&#8217;s alright. Everything is okay.<\/p>\n<p>I see now that it&#8217;s a good thing they&#8217;ve locked us all up, cause who knows what we might have done with our feelings-of-grandeur! All those attempts to save the world, and my sick desire to change normalcy. Geeez. The world is just fine, so what was I thinking?! Can you imagine what might have happened if I were still on the streets?! OMG!<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8044\" title=\"occupy-movement\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/occupy-movement-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/>And there are so many more of me out there that will be in here soon.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I welcome your company. It&#8217;s okay. Let them bring you in to get better with me. I guess we will have to have a lot more of these places built because it seems to be like a virus or disease or something. More and more people are going crazy, just like me. I hope they find a cure for it soon.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8049\" title=\"cocktail\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/cocktail-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/cocktail-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/cocktail-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/cocktail.jpg 396w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/>Well, I&#8217;ve been cured and saved from my turmoil.
