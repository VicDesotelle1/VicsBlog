Sometimes doors open when you put a stake in the ground: Last night I finally watched a presentation that I&#8217;ve been wanting to get to forever called &#8220;2012 &amp; the Fractal Brain Theory&#8221; where neuroscience thinker, Wai H. Tsang presents a revolutionary Fractal Theory of Brain, Mind &amp; Consciousness that could fundamentally alter the course of human(e) progress. This is holy grail stuff.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/09\/fractalbrain.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright\" title=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/09\/fractalbrain-150x150.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>In the video, Wai correlates new research on the brain that shows how its complexity emerges from fundamental simplicity and links it to fractal math, then\u00a0eloquently\u00a0takes the whole subject into a journey of spiritual awareness! Excellent. These are the kinds of people out there that I want to hang with, as his synthesis speaks of a new paradigm that is founded in ancient truths &#8230; fractal.<\/p>\n<h2>Moving Back into the Sacred<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/09\/sacredtechnology.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-8633 alignleft\" title=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/09\/sacredtechnology-150x150.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>From this work, I believe that we will find the scaling of anything (everything?) may end up correlating with Fractal Brain Theory. If we are to innovate ourselves out of the destructive box we&#8217;re in, we will have to paradoxically enter deep into ourselves &#8211; only to find that we &#8216;are&#8217; the Universe.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/09\/FractalUniverseBlog.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-10949 alignright\" title=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/09\/FractalUniverseBlog-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>Sound familiar? God is within us? All is one? And all that sort? Now our technology has reached a point in its fronteer that suggest undeniable connections between spirituality and science. A sort of bounded ball of inter-twine.<\/p>\n<p>The outcome is revering our creation of technology as a Sacred Act. What would our world be like from this frame of mind? How wonderful.\u00a0From this work, I propose that a model of &#8216;fractal&#8217; scaling for social innovation may be just what the doctor ordered, and will emerge a few of us addressing what is being presented in Wai&#8217;s video below.<\/p>\n<p>It seems that complexity truly is the offspring of simplicity. And from simplicity, breeds complexity. The fractal cycle of matter, and &#8216;what&#8217; matters, in this world. The future of innovation and our social well being will be founded upon this universal condition.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/2012\/04\/01\/using-fractal-mapping-to-build-organizational-inductive-performance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fractal Mapping Article<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.evernote.com\/shard\/s28\/sh\/343cf53a-140c-4924-9d15-fc82da07fc88\/2f4882eced30064b23dd13ce6295ba69\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Further notes on vic&#8217;s fractalation concepts<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ensia.com\/voices\/food-production-regenerative-agriculture-scale\/\">An example of shifting from fracture-scaling to fractal-scaling food growing systems\u00a0<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><div class=\"post-video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"2012 &amp; the Fractal Brain Theory\" width=\"1165\" height=\"655\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wnWvlyPmpBI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/48705910\">2012 &amp; the Fractal Brain Theory<\/a> from <a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/user10454815\">Paradigm Shift Productions Ltd<\/a> on <a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\">Vimeo<\/a><\/p>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-8624\" data-postid=\"8624\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-8624 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Fractal Nature of Nature There has been talk within my Facebook &#8216;Social Innovation&#8217; (SI) groups to figure out a way to scale it for growth.
