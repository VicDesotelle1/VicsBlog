I for one consist of the former and believe that this issue is one of the main reasons why many of us have been unable to get jobs, as we are on the front edge of the change curve! These changes in creativity and productivity are also why I\u00a0 believe that intellectual property (IP) design, sharing, and legal practices will continue to decay as open source (OS) becomes the norm.<\/p>\n<p>It is crucial that we deepen our understanding of these new concepts and frame them in ways for others to understand, especially company executives and human resource (HR) people.\u00a0 Vic D<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">+++<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>The authors develop this point into an argument that we need to move away from experience curves to collaboration curves. Experience curves were about the past; they contain historical experience and explicitness and sought to extract value by repeating that experience in military fashion; and, in consequence, marginal utility diminished over time while marginal costs increased, and a classic diminishing-returns model ensued. Collaboration curves, on the other hand, are about the future; they seek to containerise tacit knowledge, the ability to learn, to adapt, to evolve; value is created by making the company better at learning.&#8221;\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/n\/?bertola.bergstrand&amp;mid=6652c63G1ef6fe16G0G96&amp;bcode=aAKKEdYs_1.1341861686.AaTTWODozGvu-D9_&amp;n_m=vicdesotelle%40gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bert-Ola Bergstrand<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">+++<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/confusedofcalcutta.com\/2012\/06\/04\/on-collaboration\/comment-page-1\/#comment-859788\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>How the Social Enterprise enables this Big Shift-based collaboration<\/strong><\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #666699;\">The Social Enterprise, even in its simplest form, is designed to respond to the Big Shift, as shown below.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Built around flows, not stocks<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Underpinned by foundations of trust<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Designed to facilitate learning and memory<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Making discovery easier<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Subscriber-based<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Filtered by the network<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Making use of collective intelligence<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Simplifying pattern recognition<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Triggering beyond the tacit: the role of serendipity<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Extending beyond the enterprise<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><span style=\"color: #666699;\">[Admit it.

The list above is not really about buzzwords. If we behave like they\u2019re buzzwords, we have a fate worse than death awaiting us. We will continue to live in a world where e-mail and document attachments dominate the space that would otherwise be taken up by true collaboration. We need to understand what the terms mean, why they\u2019re important, how to embed them in our day-to-day operations. So let\u2019s look at each phrase in turn and try and figure out what it means in a work environment.\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/confusedofcalcutta.com\/2012\/06\/04\/on-collaboration\/comment-page-1\/#comment-859788\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"broken_link\"><span style=\"color: #666699;\"><span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Read more &#8230;<\/span> <\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-8337\" data-postid=\"8337\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-8337 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On Collaboration This article by ConfuseOfCalcutta.com is a must read.
