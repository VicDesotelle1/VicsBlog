Why are so many out of work? Why I can&#8217;t make ends meet at the end of the month? How come green technologies rarely seem to reach the marketplace?\u00a0Why do people do such bad things to other people and the planet? Why is it taking so long for sustainability to get implemented? How come corporations are so manipulative? Why is our government made up of people that none of us trust anymore? &#8230; WHY?<\/p>\n<p>Sure there&#8217;s those of us doing good things out there. But the overall decay of our ecological and social systems are getting worse, not better. We have to face up to this and recognize that you are not some kind of rambling &#8216;chicken little&#8217; suggesting that &#8216;the sky is falling&#8217; to say so. &#8230; No this is real. Personally, I may be cynical, but I&#8217;m an optimist at heart. And over the years, I have also become a realist, willing to look at what is happening under the covers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ABOUT NEEDED CHANGE &#8211; WHERE TO MAKE A HUGE IMPACT?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What if there were a source to our world&#8217;s major problems and we had the power to change it? Would you do something about it? What if homelessness and all our other major global problems, like pollution and war, were solvable within just a couple of years? What if paradise was actually at our door step? What if it were so palpable that you could almost taste this future? Would you act knowing that you could help and truly make a difference?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/08\/blindedbymoney.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8508\" title=\"blindedbymoney\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/08\/blindedbymoney-150x150.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/08\/blindedbymoney-150x150.jpeg 150w, https:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/08\/blindedbymoney-47x48.jpeg 47w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" \/><\/a><strong>SOCIAL INNOVATION&#8217;s ACHILLES HEEL<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Many of these questions fall under the trendy movement called &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_innovation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Social Innovation<\/a>&#8216; or &#8216;<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_entrepreneurship\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Social Entrepreneurship<\/a>&#8216;, among others, which are exciting new realms of positive change that is happening all over the planet. Yet, in order to create this wonderful world, <strong>we have to first wake up to an unspoken truth.\u00a0<\/strong>The bad guys are winning, and they are doing so using a weapon that you and I personally use every single day. Do you know what it is? This weapon is the reason that you and I have little or no power, and are feeling more and more disempowered every day.<\/p>\n<p>It also means however, because it&#8217;s in my hands, that I am the person who can help to replace the power back to the people. This is so for each of us &#8230; \u00a0for you, and you, and you. And unless we come to terms with this unspoken truth and deal with it, many of our social movements &#8211; from the Occupy Movement to the use of clean energy technologies, will eventually fail for all but the elite. I believe one third of the world is headed for\u00a0this &#8216;elite&#8217; status. The other two thirds will be enslaved to serve those elites without enough to have a happy life themselves; constantly struggling and being over-worked just to make enough for basic survival. Don&#8217;t believe it? Look out your window with different eyes. It&#8217;s already happening.<\/p>\n<h3>SO HERE&#8217;S THE PROBLEM THAT YOU AND I CAN FIX &#8230;<\/h3>\n<p><em>Watch the below videos and learn about the weapon each of us wields every day.\u00a0<\/em>Drop your denial hats at the door and stay open to what you are about to see. And rather than make vicious remarks in an attempt to deny what you hear, instead begin to ask questions and inquire with each other about what your beliefs are about money and how those beliefs are\u00a0holding us back from a better world for all, not just a few. Consider what your future role could be in creating a real live sequel to these films.<\/p>\n<p><strong>THE SECRET OF OZ HAS BEEN REVEALED.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that you know the secret, what are you going to do about it?
