They must also be aligned with how to enable meaning and metaphor from message, as well. This can not be done in the traditional way. Instead, they must be liaisons between people, not just ideas, as well as artists of the message that is based on a collective morphing of insights that emerge through shared conversation.<\/p>\n<p>A MarCom agent must now also be able to connect deeply into the engagements of company and customer, where open inquiry and questions, not surveys and assessments, are primary tools for becoming informed of both customer need and company capability. Through ongoing engagements, meaningfulness emerges, creating the link between business opportunity and customer selection and satisfaction.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, I believe that the old advertising agency, which is still afixed in our minds when thinking about &#8216;Marketing and Communications&#8217; (MarCom), is evolving into a vehicle for healthy transformation and change beyond self representation. Thus making room for a world-wide\u00a0awakening within corporate, company, and organizational, business systems.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kinda cool right?
