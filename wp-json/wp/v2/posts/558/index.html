And when I almost gave up, you asked. It&#8217;s a rather long story, but to cut it short, I am supposedly a mass communication specialist. Made my living in this profession for 30 long years. Created mass communications which helped sell several products, benefitted a number of companies. And all the while I kept wondering why when we are in direct communication with people &#8211; even one-to-one communication, there remains in most cases so much which is half understood, misunderstood or not understood at all. My wish is to ease this as far as possible. Not been very successful so far. Love to be your friend.<\/p>\n<p>Best wishes.<br \/>\nAbhijit<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/p>\n<p>Hello Abhijit,<\/p>\n<p>Yes, yes; I agree with the principle inquiry you are making.<\/p>\n<p>As a facilitator of group collaborative design processes (http:\/\/DiscoveryFuel.com), I am very interested in what makes communication happen between both individuals and the among the global collective (the masses). It has triggered some thoughts for me, which I&#8217;ve added below as a list of points.\u00a0 We may be able to build on a couple of them and see where the possibility of helping to generate more evolved forms of communication &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>1- I believe that the primary glue that holds (or doesn&#8217;t hold) a group of any kind and size together is &#8216;communication&#8217;. It seems in today&#8217;s world that building group infrastructure needs to be based on how communication emerges between individuals within companies. Rather than the other way around as we do today, where people step into preconceived info-structures.\u00a0 This backwards approach works for the masses but fails miserably for individual to individual interactions.<\/p>\n<p>2- With such poor interaction between us humans as individuals, it amazes me that functional products get out the door of any company. It does seem that &#8216;mass&#8217; communication is ruled by principles that are different than &#8216;individual&#8217; communications. This raises a thought that &#8216;fractal&#8217; theory may be relevant to clarifying and creating an evolved forms of communication.<\/p>\n<p>3- Our technologies may get out the door, which is a direct result of communication. Yet there seems to be underlying design principles that are not &#8220;communicated&#8221;, which is causing huge decline in the ecology of our earth system. This loss of &#8216;ecology&#8217; (i.e. the interaction between living systems) could be thought of as a breakdown in communication at the larger earth scale. This is beyond just human communication. The concept of &#8216;sustainability&#8217; is helping to bring in new forms of awareness into our language and as a result, the way we create and live on this planet is changing.<\/p>\n<p>4- The internet has opened a portal for entirely new forms of humane communication to emerge. What this looks like is not for any one of us to decide since they are mostly &#8217;emergent&#8217; through a collective process (i.e. emergent means showing up in organized ways that are not pre-planned). At the same time however, many of us are riding the desire for humans to connect in unique way and across world cultures (as we are now) to watch for patterns that may help to identify who we are becoming or want to become. The ideas of self responsibility, interdependence and collaboration have never been so relevant.<\/p>\n<p>5- You may want to join my new online community called http:\/\/ChangingNormal.com. It is an experiment in advancing human interaction and collaborative design, and is founded on the question: &#8220;What is communication and how does it become a tool that we use to deepen our physical and spiritual lives as both individuals and the collective become aware of communication as a guiding tool or map to the creation of chosen states of being. Rather than today&#8217;s approach to communication which metaphorically acts like a vehicle that we are unknowingly riding in. This level of conscious communication falls under what I call &#8216;the squared principle&#8217; meaning that it is about the &#8220;communication about communication&#8221;. This is what you and I are doing in this dialog.<\/p>\n<p>6- Our connection has triggered me to start a blog conversation about this subject regarding &#8216;mass communication&#8217; vs &#8216;person-to-person communication&#8217;. I was hoping that you might join me in this dialog there so that other&#8217;s may be able to jump into the conversation as well. Plus it will be easier for us to review, synthesize, and track the lineage of conversations that emerge.
