The resulting diagrams show digital clusters of self-truths that create walls between each other, undermining the potential for any deeper understanding emerge and meaning-making to arise. Meaning by the way, is humanity\u2019s primary pathway to spirituality.<\/p>\n<p>One of the primary valuations of the dollar (or any currency) appears in how we connect with each other. Under today\u2019s currency, money creates inherent competition forcing isolation of truth into bubbles of self identification and increases the desire for self-centering power, that is then used to downplay and denigrate other\u2019s truths in the name of their own.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine instead, news outlets shifting from being informational channels, to becoming a common medium (media) for integrating (rather than isolating) shared knowledge. This would allow for measurable correlations between conversational depth, monetary exchange, and world wealth (used here in its broadest meaning) to help humanity monitor its own transformation of rising (or decaying) values, where that value can only be done through second degree assessment of conversational relationships.<\/p>\n<p>This approach would turn organizational \u2018valuations\u2019 (which are presently determined almost completely by dollar potential only) inside-out. Allowing for currency to return to its original intent, which was to represent the meaning (rather \u2018be\u2019 the meaning) of how we determine value in one another.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, the analysis of news through social media becomes a critical tool in creating capital as a dynamic (no longer static) meaningful world.<\/p>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-10146\" data-postid=\"10146\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-10146 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>An interesting realm to look into that can be used to determine the efficacy of a currency (and\/or various forms of capital) is done by monitoring news media conversations.
