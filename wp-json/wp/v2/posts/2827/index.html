The professor then said, &#8220;OK, we will have an experiment in this class on Obama&#8217;s plan&#8221;. All grades would be averaged and everyone would receive the same grade so no one would fail and no one would receive an A.<\/p>\n<p>After the first test, the grades were averaged and everyone got a B. The students who studied hard were upset and the students who studied little were happy.<\/p>\n<p>As the second test rolled around, the students who studied little had studied even less and the ones who studied hard decided they wanted a free ride too so they studied little. The second test average was a D! No one was happy.<\/p>\n<p>When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F. The scores never increased as bickering, blame and name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for the benefit of anyone else.<\/p>\n<p>All failed, to their great surprise, and the professor told them that socialism would also ultimately fail because when the reward is great, the effort to succeed is great but when government takes all the reward away, no one will try or want to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>YOU KNOW WHAT ???<\/p>\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t feel right to me, but I&#8221;m not completely sure why. This report seems to be based on one of those quick conclusions and not enough interaction or detailed data. When analyzed I&#8217;m convinced that it would not provide enough evidence to support the writers own (seemingly biased?) conclusion.<\/p>\n<p>But what also comes up for me is a sense of despair: Is this the future of humanity? Does the rich guy really deserve a better life, and the poor guy deserve a struggling life? Or is this written by someone that sees his\/her whole life through a money-lens?<\/p>\n<p>But maybe I am missing something? What about you? What comes up for you when you read this? How does the system that is in place now work? How does it not work? What assumptions do we have about &#8216;socialism&#8217;, and about &#8216;capitalism&#8217;? For me, it seems that socialism tends toward making everyone &#8216;equal&#8217; through government process &#8211; i.e. financial wealth is distributed so that money is not a reason for someone to have a bad life.<\/p>\n<p>And capitalism, on the other hand, tends toward giving everyone the &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to create a life filled with financial wealth. And, it&#8217;s up to each person to take advantage of this &#8211; to make the necessary money to be well-off. Yet does it consider how ones own wealth affects others well-being and the strange chasm between the rich and poor?<\/p>\n<p><strong>For me, neither capitalism nor socialism is a workable solution. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>However, there is something in the combining the two concepts that I believe will bring a new economic system that uses money completely differently. One that combines our individual sense of identity and personal power, with a collective ability to allow all to be free from lives that are based in tyranny &#8211; which is directly related to one&#8217;s ability to access to money systems.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that will be hard to convince me otherwise (but I will stay open!), is that <strong>&#8216;innovation&#8217; as we know it must evolve beyond the conditions and thinking that created the society that has resulted from it so far. <\/strong>Sound familiar? Yah, Einstein said something similar. From my mind, he is soooo right. And that&#8217;s why I am a supporter of this new concept called &#8216;sustainable&#8217; innovation, which this website discoveryfuel.com is all about.<\/p>\n<p>RESPOND below, and stay tuned to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>In my mind, the term &#8216;collaboration&#8217; integrates both individual (capitalistic) and collective (socialistic) needs and desires. Thus, it <strong>IS<\/strong> the future. I encourage all readers to study it closely. Do not place collaboration in the category of socialism, for that is incorrect.<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;<\/p>\n<p>That said: I want to open this up to a <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bohm_Dialogue\" target=\"_blank\">real dialogue<\/a> here (not a discussion or debate) &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>What QUESTIONS (not opinions or answers) really need to be asked here? What might be missing? What is totally right on? What underlying emotions make you feel uncomfortable or comfortable about this article? How does it relate to the world&#8217;s past, present, and future situations? And how do we learn to evolve toward a way of life that feels more right, or more peaceful? &#8230; Or is that even the right question?<\/p>\n<p>What are YOUR questions?<\/p>\n<p>NOTE: When you respond, don&#8217;t let your expectations or belief systems play into your comments if at all possible (This is virtually impossible.)\u00a0 But even more important is: What QUESTIONS (rather than opinions or answers) really need to be asked here? Make no assumptions, be judgmental of nothing, and inquire with a completely open mind. Try googling on the phrase: &#8220;you cannot multiply wealth by dividing it&#8221;, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=%22you+cannot+multiply+wealth+by+dividing+it%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a\" target=\"_blank\">or click here<\/a> and you will here many different opinions.<\/p>\n<p>Please remember and experiment with the following point: <em><strong>The &#8216;question&#8217; is far more powerful than any answer<\/strong><\/em> that you think you can come up with in this time of great change. So, what are your questions? Can you do it without bias?
