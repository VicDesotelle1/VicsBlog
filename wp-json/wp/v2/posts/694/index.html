Additionally David Armano tells a story here of how positive interactions with his iPod has changed his &#8216;dropping&#8217; behavior. This triggered an insight for me that is relevant to collaboration and design. Online collaboration tools are rapidly filling a new industry space, and it is my belief this phenomena will continue to grow and evolve to the point where human interaction will dramatically increase within the virtual space of the web. Now, did you feel a hit in your gut with what I just said? Some of you, I&#8217;m sure, felt excited. And many of you, I&#8217;ll bet, heard an inner voice of concern for how you think technology is separating our humanity by disconnecting us from our physical interactions. You know, after a lot of thought about this, I think this later hit needs serious review. Certainly it is going to change our behaviors. That is, the ways in which we interact and are comfortable with, are going to change. Personally, I have gone from a place of concern, to being keenly watchful of what&#8217;s happening, to going fully on board with these changes. To the point where I have committed myself to a study and emerging business offering of online collaboration environments. Because I see it as the future of how we can rapidly change (shall we say) our &#8216;meta&#8217; behaviors on this planet for the betterment of a world that we want to live in.<\/p>\n<p>I encourage you to open your mind and heart to the possibilities that might unfold for you and others by daring to step into the uncomfortable places being created for collaboration within the online virtual world. For me, thinking about what I can design and who I can design with rrrrreally exicites me because possibilities have opened up to a point where my long standing vision and bag full of ideas could actually be manifested. So cool! All with what I believe will include a deeper sense of compassion and reverence for our world and the people in it. Also note that, so far, it has been WAY easier for me to find others that think like me and want to create things that I am interested in &#8230;.\u00a0 And I find that even more exciting!<\/p>\n<p>Sooooo, behavior change? Yup. It&#8217;s happening, and that&#8217;s a good thing in my book. As long as we stay conscious watchers of the changes that are occurring and constantly question them deeply and collaboratively.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk more about this soon.<\/p>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-694\" data-postid=\"694\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-694 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I watched this interesting video on company and personal branding, which are often one in the same these days.
