Thus, we must evolve our approaches toward innovation, including a new eye on leadership. This article addresses leadership from a very different perspective. How do we bring in new forms of technologies, build conscious business paradigms, support social issues, and formulate economies that create well being in our communities?<\/p>\n<p>To create a better world for our children and our children\u2019s children, we need to apply leadership in a new way. &#8216;Authentic Leadership&#8217; addresses this need. Specifically, it reshapes our way of thinking and collaborating. It helps us to make more choices available to more people, and to make better decisions by using evolved forms of collaboration and individual empowerment. This kind of leadership is what is needed to help us build a sustainable vibrant world society.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Authenticity is the difference between leading and leadership<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>There is a difference between practicing formulated exercises to create personal change, and experiencing deep transformational change through self awareness. This is done by first empowering yourself as a leader based on your interests, capabilities, and passions, to realize your own unique authentic identity.<\/p>\n<p>Once this is achieved, a shift in personal understanding of leadership will occur. With this shift, comes an evolution in the way you are able to help others realize their own power and their own sense of leadership. Thus, you become a catalyst for change rather than a director of change.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/12\/millett_leading_the_charge150x150.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-10620 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/12\/millett_leading_the_charge150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>The primary role of an Authentic Leader is to follow change from behind, not direct it from from the front.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s right: I said \u2018follow\u2019.

This is not empowering and does not lead others toward their own authority. Realizing this is a big step toward becoming an authentic leader. To do this, the way leadership is viewed has to change:<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><em>Rather than placing your leadership in front of others<\/em> <em>and \u2018leading the cha<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>r<\/strong><\/span><\/span>ge\u2019, you instead follow and keep a watchful eye for the opportunities to<\/em> <em>\u2018catalyze desired cha<span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>n<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/em><em>ge\u2019.

Both have their role in evolving a society. However, &#8216;follower&#8217; lead approach focuses on creating the new by recognizing when old principles, rules, and behaviors don&#8217;t work anymore. Unlike &#8216;director&#8217; leadership, &#8216;follower&#8217; leadership allows effort to be on creating the new without putting energy on breaking down old norms that no longer serve us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This actually is the only way real change happens, since killing off the people and systems that serve the old way does not in fact kill off the behavior of that old way. When you look at history, our revolutions, which arise to address needed change, have not really been effective. The same patterns have tended to repeat themselves over and over. <em><span style=\"color: #800000;\">To create real change, we must attend to the emerging new, not put energy into eliminating the old.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"font-size-5\"><strong style=\"color: #800000;\"><span style=\"color: #800000;\">The \u2018Bulls-Eye\u2019 &#8211; An Old Metaphor for Leading and Succeeding<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<h3><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/12\/images3150x150.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-10622\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/12\/images3150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a><\/h3>\n<p>Have you seen how the target is so often used as a business metaphor? I do like this metaphor of the arrow hitting the bulls-eye, but for a different reason than you may think. What if, for the authentic leader, it is no longer appropriate to aim for the center of the target? What if your best shot is actually when the arrow lands in the furthest outer ring?<\/p>\n<p>For the authentic leader, viewing situations from a target&#8217;s periphery is more powerful than from its center. The edge is a place where you have to be more a part of the interactions with others. You are not at the center of the world for all to adore. The new leader has moved passed his own &#8220;me center&#8221; needs that satisfy personal ego. Instead respect is gained by risking at the edge. Risking being seen in in the vulnerability of one&#8217;s humanity as a person that makes mistakes and is flawed like we all are. The periphery of the target is not as safe as the center. It&#8217;s at this periphery, and not the center, where an authentic leader&#8217;s true power is realized.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><em>In Leadership Ecology, you want to target the OUTER ring, not the center bulls-eye.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>From the outer ring you have a very different perspective on leadership. By placing yourself in the outer ring, you are in the best position to move <em>others<\/em> into the center, not you. Aiming for this part of the target also challenges your own awareness, and thereby your authenticity as a person. And this is so important as a leader, because people can feel your truth. It is not as hidden as you may think. Most can tell when you are not really coming from your authentic self.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"font-size-5\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Mirror Mirror on the Wall \u2026<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/12\/mirrormirror150x150-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-10623\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/12\/mirrormirror150x150-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>Each of us sees ourselves best by reflecting off of others. In fact, I propose that it\u2019s the ONLY way we can see our true authentic selves. That is, your ability to be truly who you are will become evident once you surround yourself with others who can empathize with your life path and compassionately share with you how they see you. This mirroring concept is core to good a leader&#8217;s ability to facilitate others along their path.<\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #800000;\">It is the authentic leader&#8217;s responsibility to be a reflection of you. It must be done in a nonjudgmental way, while at the same time being boldly-truthful &#8211; a mirror of \u2018you\u2019.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p>A mirrored message can not be recognized by you until someone actually reflects it back to you, and taking in reflected (mirrored) messages can be difficult. Often, what another says about you triggers the ego\u2019s protection mechanisms. But allow them anyway. Permitting these reflections will help you see through your own forest of day-to-day trials. As you serve others in this way your own leadership qualities and abilities improve and becomes more meaningful. As a mirror, you generate and acknowledge your own insights with others. This process actually becomes a spiritual journey as you enter into your own personal labyrinth toward becoming more aware.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"font-size-5\"><strong><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Creating an Ecology of Leadership<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/12\/15527orangepersonstuckinthemiddleofacircleofcautionsignsclipartillustrationimage150x150.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-10624\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/12\/15527orangepersonstuckinthemiddleofacircleofcautionsignsclipartillustrationimage150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/><\/a>When we come to realize our own authentic identity, we move to a place of compassion and empathy for others. Rather than being in the front office, where too often isolated decisions are made, instead your influence radiates out in an attempt to partner with others. You no longer are a director overseeing subordinates, but instead see value in empowering others, helping to shape an empowered network of interactions. A &#8216;Leadership Ecology&#8217; begins to form.<\/p>\n<p>Evolving an &#8216;Ecology of Leadership\u2019 is not done by placing yourself at the center of attention, or at the front of the room with everyone&#8217;s eyes pointed at you. Rather, it is done by positioning yourself to easily focus on others in the group, not them being focused on you.

To really grok its value, and to see authentic transformation, this kind of work must be experienced in the day to day trials of your life. You must actually walk through the labyrinth of your own making, not just think about it. This often starts with a coach or mentor \u2013 someone who can support you as you move toward the root of personal insight. Insights that will include valuable tools for using on the job. Such as, becoming more clear about situational problems, the ability to recognize employee character behaviors, understanding resulting decisions that they make, and how to help each other evolve into the creation of collaborative solutions.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800000;\"><em>Realizing our authentic self is the true power source of all good leaders \u2026 Once obtained, they give it away freely.<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p>You will also become skilled at both offering and receiving acknowledgment \u2013 from a place that goes beyond selfish ego.
