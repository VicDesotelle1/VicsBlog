Principle is highly intentional and not always tangible in its early stages. When principle moves into action, it looks like an early practicing community.<\/p>\n<p>If we look at systems that are fixed inherently within human(e) discourse, there are those that act in PRACTICE (communities), others by defining POLICY and rules (government), and others guided by PRINCIPLE (emergent organizing structures like the Occupy Movement).<\/p>\n<p>*Principle groups are a bit futuristic, presenting what needs to happen (intentional vision, where we are headed).<br \/>\n*Policy is of the past, it keeps culture in place based on what has happened (lessons learned; where we come from).<br \/>\n*Practice is the activity that we monitor between the two &#8211; A feedback that signals when it&#8217;s time to realign our principles with practice.<\/p>\n<p>Government will try to rule over principle making groups, attempting to rein them back into the order it oversees. This is it&#8217;s job and purpose. However, when the policy making part of this system goes rogue, and thinks it leads over principle, and no longer recognizes its purpose to regulate between principle and practice, it then fails to serve its purpose. At this time, it signals the overall system that it&#8217;s time to change our governing body.<\/p>\n<p>The outcome of Occupy is what the signaled us to this occurring. Flagging a time for not just realignment, but systemic change.
