Please watch this video &#8216;first&#8217;, then read my article, and please share your thoughts with me in the comments box. I find the underlying topic of the video (i.e. not the subjects of the video themselves) to be a source of volatility and danger. Yet as well, vitality and nourishment are contained therein that can help us become empowered to direct what our future is to become.<\/p>\n<div class=\"post-video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;If I wanted America to fail&quot;\" width=\"1165\" height=\"655\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/CZ-4gnNz0vc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>This video is an emotionally drawing, well synthesized, manipulation of content that both inspires and conspires. Very well done. It is an excellent piece to bring into conversation for &#8216;The Next Edge&#8217;, &#8216;ConversationCafe.org&#8217;, and similar groups.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8075\" title=\"220px-Paying_Toll_on_passing_a_Bridge_From_a_Painted_Window_in_the_Cathedral_of_Tournay_Fifteenth_Century.png\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/220px-Paying_Toll_on_passing_a_Bridge_From_a_Painted_Window_in_the_Cathedral_of_Tournay_Fifteenth_Century.png-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/>The video directs watchers toward a toll on the bridge, where humanity has staged a stand-off between &#8216;knowledge and intent&#8217;, and &#8216;values and value&#8217;. It is mixed with both wrong and right points that influence the watcher&#8217;s mind, depending on which side of the bridge you start from.<\/p>\n<p>To take messages like this &#8216;as-is&#8217; and attempt to stand for your view through reason is suicide. But to collaboratively play with the video&#8217;s nuances can help to realize new forms of awareness that become a foundation for humanity&#8217;s crossing into our future. A forecast that, by design, does not force individuals to take a stand, but to instead freely cross destiny&#8217;s bridge to address our fate together.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8076\" title=\"stock-photo-unhappy-male-protester-broadcasting-a-speech-and-proclamation-of-protest-when-making-a-statement-of-92199523\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/stock-photo-unhappy-male-protester-broadcasting-a-speech-and-proclamation-of-protest-when-making-a-statement-of-92199523-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/>I encourage those who come to this grand dialog to not distain nor proclaim the video&#8217;s message as &#8216;reasonable&#8217;. Do not take a stand. Rather, become a watcher of what emerges from within a rich non-defensive dialog about the subjects this video brings front-and-center. Allow the unfolding of unexpected answers to happen &#8211; those that can only be realized from within a collaborative generative conversation. A gathering where the badges of &#8216;expert&#8217; and &#8216;authority&#8217; are left at the gate. Allow its content to guide us (rather than collide us) toward destiny&#8217;s call.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8077\" title=\"clay-college-2.jpeg\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/04\/clay-college-2.jpeg-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/>Let us use information, such as what is described in this video, to move ourselves from the dangers of positioning an &#8217;emergency&#8217; into a place of &#8217;emergence&#8217;, where wonder and creativity (not just rationality and fact) are the foundations for shaping our future.<\/p>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-8071\" data-postid=\"8071\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-8071 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Notice! : I recently received negative feedback on this article.
