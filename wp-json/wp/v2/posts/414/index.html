Yet the guru&#8217;s say that we are makers of our own reality &#8211; an inner perspective. So, if you go within yourself, then all the power you need to change is there. Well I would hereby like to raise the B.S. flag.<\/p>\n<p>From this guy&#8217;s mountain top view both are correct. It is not one or the other that brings us to Nirvana. It is the dance between the Inner and the Outer that IS the FULL reality. For my world, your fire&#8217;s reality is outside of me. Yet in your world, your life&#8217;s flame is within you. So inner and outer are very relative to whose doing the conscious perceiving, right?<\/p>\n<p>So the new Story (I believe) will be based on the relationship between INNER and OUTER reality. Between what happens withIN me and at the same time what happens withOUT me. (Notice my use of the word &#8216;without&#8217; is different that is normally used.)<\/p>\n<p>Interesting that is what Collaboration is all about. It is an unfolding story of how you the individual and we the collective are considered and co-created together. Diversity is from the individual theme, and Unity is from the collective theme. And COLLABORATION is just another way to describe the dance that occurs between me and them, you and us, I and we.<\/p>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-414\" data-postid=\"414\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-414 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So what&#8217;s real?
