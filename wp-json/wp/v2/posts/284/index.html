We have a great deal in common.<\/p>\n<p>In the beginning, you seemed concerned with being boxed in and I hope that feeling lessened by the end of our conversation.\u00a0 While we don&#8217;t like being labeled, we actually spend our entire life ensuring that we are. Individuality is not a state of doing in the sense of achievement but rather a way of life. It is how we pursue our desires. Liberty requires the freedom to choose the conditions in which to aspire toward our goals. Choosing our own direction makes our identity our own freely chosen.\u00a0 Autonomy ensures self-development and cultivation of our faculties in the hopes of finding the best direction for full expression.<\/p>\n<p>This self-direction finds structure by us always heading toward fulfilling our satisfaction of wants and desires and these passions are again structured in abeyance to the living design of our choices, heading toward our individual interpretation of what is fulfillment. The model of self is always imploding and feeding off itself.\u00a0 Our identity finds definition in moral orientation that exists beneath the culturally imposed topography of self (Synthetic). We frame our inner self (Authentic) within a universally valid commitment and it is this commitment that generates our external manifestation.<\/p>\n<p>If we were to lose this sense of orientation we would not know who we are. It is this linguistically transcending orientation that defines where you answer from when asked &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;. It is an abstract feeling that attaches to physicality of language. Our orientation is in this moral space&#8211;the\u00a0 ontological basis to self. That is, to say that your Authentic Motivator is &#8220;Spiritual Connection&#8221; is a symbolic simulation at best.<\/p>\n<p>To cultivate the &#8220;self&#8221; is to cultivate a &#8220;way of being&#8221; that has form. Even to say that all is relative and absolutes do not exist is still a &#8220;way of being.&#8221; Freedom is the willingness to be self-shackled.<\/p>\n<p>I thought you might enjoy some additional thoughts on the subject.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you&#8217;d like to know what truely motivates you at your core, as well as what&#8217;s stoping you from achieving your goals, take John&#8217;s <a title=\"Get real, and discover your true self\" href=\"http:\/\/www.discoveryfuel.com\/authentic-identity-assessment\" target=\"_self\">Authentic Identity Assessment<\/a> and learn the truth about&#8230;you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-284\" data-postid=\"284\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-284 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is a real experience relating to my own personal authenticty awarenesss and development.
