The world is cracking and inside is something completely different for us to feast on. Yes, the turmoil part is painful; very very painful. Yet we&#8217;ve got to feed off the energy of what is working, of what feels exciting, to get us out of the unsustainable mess we&#8217;re in on this planet. Right? Don&#8217;t you agree?<\/p>\n<p>Take this article I came across today in Business Week Magazine. You must read it. Note that it dates back to 2005, which is a phenomena in itself &#8211; the fact that we all want to keep with what&#8217;s going on but the train is moving to fast to get on board (but that&#8217;s another story for later) &#8230; So, anyway, the article lists a bunch of &#8216;people power pioneers&#8217; like Wikipedia&#8217;s CEO and so on. It also lists many examples of how fast this so-called &#8216;collaboration&#8217; train is really moving. Getting to market is taking a fraction of the time. All due to world-wide collaboration that is occuring due to the boom of emerging user-friendly (or getting that way) online tools. Now these tools are getting better and better. Each day I find another one that is easier to use, cheaper (very often free!). There are now over 3,000 collaboration tools online today &#8211; It&#8217;s truly overwhelming!<\/p>\n<p>The interesting point that I want to make here is that, rather than a company making a tool hoping to fit a market need, most of these tools are being made by the users themselves that need them. I am a good example of this as I am presently seeking out tool designers that can create a user friendly application that follows principles of Discovery Fuel&#8217;s &#8216;Colabs&#8217; collaboration concepts. Hec, I&#8217;m going to make my own tool. (By the way, know of anyone I should talk to?) Whereas, a couple of years ago I could have never considered this. This kind of practice is turning the marketplace on its head. I love it! Why? Because I am seeing &#8216;opportunity&#8217; (which shows up in every crisis) for the little guy, of which there are millions, to make a living in unique, freeing, wonderous, and purposeful ways. So, keep an eye on <a href=\"http:\/\/discoveryfuel.com\/client-tools\/\" target=\"_blank\">Discovery Fuel&#8217;s Online Collaboration Tools<\/a> page. There&#8217;s much to come as we saddle up to ride into the virtual Colab on the horizon.<\/p>\n<p>Hec, maybe we can &#8220;collaborate&#8221; on some things together \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<p>Vic, D.F.<\/p>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-741\" data-postid=\"741\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-741 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is such exciting times that we live in.
