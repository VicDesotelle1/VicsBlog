You will see more discussions relating to these concepts from me over time. Let me know what comes up for you when you read through it. For now, soak your mind on this draft concept and see what comes up for you &#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transformation (deep innovation) occurs through a three phase evolution:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the potential for progressing toward a global mind: My experiences with group emergence have noted that a majority of efforts collapse before the desire is sustained and self-propelled; a progression toward the vision that initiated the group in the first place. I propose the reason for this is that there is only a one or two level strategic plan in place made up of immediate context without the anticipation of collective content; a synthesis from which the incredible happens.<\/p>\n<p>What if we instead provide a guiding framework that allows group migration into deeper forms of connection with each other? Eventually this connection moves into behavioral forms of change and action. I believe this can be done using a 3-phase framework for processing together; thereby allowing a group to consciously see itself go through deep transformation. This would mean for each phase of processing together, there is a SYNTHESIS of its content &#8211; a summarizing of what has been done. This would occur as a part of all three phases; thereby generating a thread of synthesis that allows for FRACTAL integration.<\/p>\n<p><strong>These three phases are as follows, which can be noted in the 8-gate group alignment map diagram:<\/strong><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8456\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8456\" style=\"width: 169px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/03\/8GateAlignmentMap.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-8456 \" title=\"8GateAlignmentMap\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/03\/8GateAlignmentMap-150x150.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"169\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/03\/8GateAlignmentMap-150x150.jpeg 150w, https:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2011\/03\/8GateAlignmentMap-744x1024-47x48.jpeg 47w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 169px) 100vw, 169px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-8456\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Click To View Map<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>1- Establishing Group Intention: <\/strong><br \/>\nThis phase&#8217;s nature is chaotic. It is expressed by conversations of desire and passion which drive an unfolding *PROCESS*. A focus on creating +PRINCIPLES+ based on diverse values, which opens of new level of awareness; thereby setting the stage for a loosening of existing physical *structure* and allowing change to occur. Vibrational activity is dissonant (unconscious) and non-geometric.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2- Building a Value Network: <\/strong><br \/>\nThis phase&#8217;s nature moves from chaotic to chaordic. It is expressed by individuals linking and clustering around collective ideas &#8211; a virtual *STRUCTURE* emerges. A focus on creating +PRACTICES+ sets the stage for individual changes in behavior and an early forming of group identity to occur. Vibrational activity is recognizable (awakening consciousness) but not stable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3- Experiencing a Community of Practice: <\/strong><br \/>\nThis phase&#8217;s nature moves from chaordic into order. It is expressed by the emergence of community (collective) identity PATTERNS to be realized and an acceptance of participatory-oriented activities are in place. A focus on creating +POLICY+ is empasized; thereby a change of governance occurs.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/2012\/06\/27\/collaboration-is-the-new-government\/\" target=\"_blank\">Go here<\/a> for more on the relationships between\u00a0Principle, Practice, and Policy.
