Especially, the super heroes of mythical stories allow the socially suppressed to have something to hold onto that is strong and good -It provides a sense of hope for a better life. Hero movies often touch on, if not lead, the meaning of our present culture&#8217;s beliefs and driving forces. Forces that move a society forward. They reflect a rising desire or struggle in both the individual and as a collective.<\/p>\n<p>The idea of the &#8216;smart&#8217; super hero is on top for 2012.

Plans for this movie becoming a mega-block buster suggests it&#8217;s story is addressing a rising desire within us. Some are aware of it, but most of us are not.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-6527\" title=\"Screen shot 2012-01-01 at 8.24.17 PM\" src=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/01\/Screen-shot-2012-01-01-at-8.24.17-PM-300x79.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"79\" srcset=\"http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/01\/Screen-shot-2012-01-01-at-8.24.17-PM-300x79.png 300w, http:\/\/discoverycolabs.com\/vicsblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2012\/01\/Screen-shot-2012-01-01-at-8.24.17-PM.png 518w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>There is a growing edge of discomfort occurring world-wide, and I believe that it is crucial to keep an eye on emerging mythical stories that are being told in film and other medium. For it provides us with a crystal ball that reveals an emerging future. Watch how movies are talked about at\u00a0 home, at work, and on political stages. Look for changes in the myths that are told. How is the super hero&#8217;s story changing and why? And how does it reflect real world circumstances?.
