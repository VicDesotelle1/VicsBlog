That is, we must redesign our underlying methods for designing technologies. To do this, we will have to take a much bigger look at how we define &#8211; not just the end-result, but also reconsider the actual design processes themselves by asking questions such as: &#8216;why&#8217; are we designing a given technology in the first place?, &#8216;how&#8217; does this technology need to be created with alternative design principles in mind (see Bucky Fuller&#8217;s Design Science as an example)?, &#8216;what&#8217; will be different about the form and function of the end-product?, &#8216;who&#8217; does the technology affect?, and what is its (w)holistic impact on the greater earth ecology of living systems?<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d love to hear from you all what you and your teams are doing to make this shift in technology design thinking.<\/p>\n<p>Vic Desotelle<br \/>\nhttp:\/\/DiscoveryFuel.com<\/p>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-846\" data-postid=\"846\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-846 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A critical piece to technological success in an emerging era of the green (or sustainable) design marketplace is to, not just create cool, cutting edge technologies, but to also define design itself differently so that technology&#8217;s underlying processes comply with the new principles of triple bottom line (sustainability) management.
